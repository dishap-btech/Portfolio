                <p>I am Disha Prashanth, a first year student of computer science, hailing from Bangalore. My love for science and technology made me choose this stream. As a child I was always focused on academic excellence and learning new skills. I strongly believe that a solid foundation is essential to stay ahead in the learning journey, whether in academics or arts and culture. My school, my parents and mentors have helped me in building this foundation. I am also passionate about music, crochet and travelling. They create a sense of calm and also boost my creativity. I wish to leverage my skills and technology in helping society and businesses on their digital transformation journey.</p>
